				<p>The land on which Hollywood Memorial Park and Cemetery lies has historical significance. During the Revolutionary War, the Battle of Connecticut Farms was fought there.</p> 
				<p>Hollywood Cemetery, comprising 25 acres, was founded in 1909 and was originally known as Union Cemetery Association. In 1938, Hollywood Memorial Park, comprising 70 acres, was created. The two properties merged in 1991 to become Hollywood Memorial Park and Cemetery.</p> 
				<p>The first memorial park in New Jersey to significantly commit to the mausoleum concept in 1950, Hollywood Memorial Park and Cemetery offers six mausoleums to serve as magnificent and inspirational places for individuals to memorialize their loved ones. Fully carpeted and climate-controlled, the mausoleums offer a comfortable, dignified setting in which families can quietly meditate or pray while being protected from the weather year-round. The new mausoleum, Chapel of Everlasting Peace, has been completed.</p>
